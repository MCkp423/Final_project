# Advanced Analytics for Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Machine Learning Approach

Objective;

The main goal of this project is to create and assess machine learning models that can accurately detect and predict credit card transactions. The focus lies in utilizing Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithms to classify transactions, as either fraudulent or non fraudulent ultimately ensuring the security and reliability of transactions.

Key Tasks and Methodology;

Model Creation;

Build Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using transaction data. The primary aim is to classify transactions based on patterns. Model Evaluation;

Compare the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. This step is vital in determining the model for fraud detection. Analysis of Confusion Matrix;

Examine the confusion matrix for each model. Gain insights into positives, positives true negatives and false negatives. Data Preprocessing and Handling Class Imbalance;

Normalize features like 'Time' and 'Amount'. Implement techniques like undersampling or oversampling to address class imbalance within the dataset. Feature Analysis;

Assess the significance of features in predicting fraud. Conduct analyses. Visualize data to understand how specific features influence fraud prediction. Model Robustness Testing;

Evaluate the models, under scenarios to determine their resilience.To ensure the models maintain their effectiveness, amidst evolving transaction patterns and fraud techniques it is important to assess the feasibility of real time detection. This involves evaluating the efficiency and integration requirements necessary for processing transactions. The overarching objective is to enhance fraud detection mechanisms in credit card transactions ultimately reducing instances of fraud and safeguarding transactions. This project combines techniques, statistical insights and machine learning to develop a scalable and efficient system, for detecting fraudulent activities.
